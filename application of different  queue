 Applications of Simple Queue (Linear Queue)
A simple queue is a basic linear queue where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Once an element is dequeued, the position cannot be reused, which can lead to inefficient use of memory. Despite this, simple queues have important uses:

Print Spooling: When multiple print jobs are sent to a printer, they are lined up in a queue, processed one at a time in the order they are received.

Task Scheduling: In operating systems, jobs are placed in a queue and executed in the order they arrive. This is common in batch processing systems.

Customer Service Systems: In customer service (like call centers or bank queues), requests are handled in the order they are received.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Graphs: BFS uses a simple queue to explore all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level in a graph traversal.

2. Applications of Circular Queue
A circular queue is a more efficient version of a linear queue. In a circular queue, when the rear reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning if space is available. This allows better utilization of memory.

Memory Management in Computer Systems: Circular queues are used in situations where memory is limited, such as when implementing buffers or managing limited resources.

CPU Scheduling (Round Robin): Circular queues are used in the round-robin scheduling algorithm where each process gets an equal time slice. After a process finishes its time, itâ€™s moved to the back of the queue, and the next process is picked from the front.

Traffic Light System: Circular queues can be used in traffic light systems, where a fixed sequence of events (green, yellow, red) must cycle in a loop.

Streaming Buffers: In media streaming, circular buffers (a form of circular queue) store data temporarily while it is being read and written at different rates.

Real-Time Systems: In real-time processing, circular queues are used in the implementation of task scheduling to ensure that each task gets an opportunity to execute.

3. Applications of Doubly-Ended Queue (Deque)
A deque (doubly-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion from both ends, making it more flexible than simple and circular queues.

Palindrome Checking: A deque can be used to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.

Undo/Redo Operations in Applications: Many applications (text editors, Photoshop, etc.) allow users to undo and redo their actions. A deque is used to manage this because it can efficiently add and remove elements from both the front and the back.

Sliding Window Problems: In algorithms that involve a sliding window (such as finding the maximum or minimum element in a moving window of fixed size), deques are highly efficient because they can add and remove elements from both ends.

Task Scheduling with Priority: Deques are useful in systems where tasks need to be scheduled with priority. For example, important tasks might need to be pushed to the front of the queue, while less important tasks are added at the back.

Real-time Data Processing: In systems that require real-time data processing, such as real-time stock price updates or traffic monitoring, deques can be used to keep track of the most recent data, removing older data from the front while adding newer data to the back.
